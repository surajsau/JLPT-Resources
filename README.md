# JLPT-Resources
Some CSV files with all vocab and kanji from JLPT N1, N2, N3, N4, N5. The separation value is '|' I did this out of convenience for the projects I'm working on  as this character never exists in any of my scripts which I use. Easy to change to whatever you want :p 

If you have anything to add or think needs changing, please feel free to do so. ^^
